Avogadro on babel:

cmake -DEIGEN_INCLUDE_DIR="/home/agilbert/development/eigen/" 
      -DOPENBABEL2_INCLUDE_DIR="/home/agilbert/development/openbabel/include/openbabel-2.0" 
      -DOPENBABEL2_LIBRARIES="home/agilbert/development/openbabel/lib/libopenbabel.so" ../

Avogadro on Stowe:

cmake -DEIGEN_INCLUDE_DIR=/Users/agilbert/Desktop/Avogadro/eigen
      -DOPENBABEL2_LIBRARIES=/usr/local/lib/libopenbabel.3.dylib
      -DOPENBABEL2_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/include/openbabel-2.0 
      //-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PEFIX=/Applications
      //-DLIB_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/lib
      ../

This is the command used to generate the .pro file:
qmake -makefile -spec macx-g++ -o Makefile 


install_name_tool -change QtCore.framework/Versions/4/QtCore @executable_path/../Frameworks/QtCore.framework/Versions/4/QtCore QUI.app/Contents/Frameworks/QtSql.framework/Versions/4/QtSql


install_name_tool -change QtSql.framework/Versions/4/QtSql @executable_path/../Frameworks/QtSql.framework/Versions/4/QtSql QUI.app/Contents/PlugIns/sqldrivers/libqsqlite.dylib
install_name_tool -change QtCore.framework/Versions/4/QtCore @executable_path/../Frameworks/QtCore.framework/Versions/4/QtCore QUI.app/Contents/PlugIns/sqldrivers/libqsqlite.dylib

still to do:


CIS panel
 - move to excited states (not correlated methods)
 - CIS_STATE_DERIV needs to be added and should only be activated if JOBTYPE is 
   optimization or frequency.  should also be less than CIS_N_ROOTS

 - CIS options should only be enabled if CIS_N_ROOTS is greateer than 0

core_character currently integers, should probably be set to strings.



Policies:

o Rem variable names are stored in the database in UPPERCASE
o Rem values can be a mixture of cases and should therefore be compared within
  the program in a case insensitive fashion
  
o Advanced Options Stack.  Each page should be called Advanced* where * is the
  text in the category tree list.
